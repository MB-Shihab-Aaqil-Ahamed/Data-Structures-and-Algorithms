## Income Tax Liability

Jeff is a financial planner and, he provides various services to his clients with varying levels of income. He wants to help families continue growing wealth while helping young families reach their financial goals. He calculates the income tax returns for his clients, and most of his clients have various sources of income. To make his job easier, he needs an application to identify the income tax liability for his single filer clients. This application should get the no. of income sources and the income from each source as user input and if the income from each source exceeds $9,950, then he/she is liable to pay the tax for that income. Then the application should display the no. of taxable income from various sources. Otherwise, a message should display, â€œNot liable to pay income taxâ€.
