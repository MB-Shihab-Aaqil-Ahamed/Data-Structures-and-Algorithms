Assume that you have a curtain rod and many rings. Each ring has a number printed on it. You need to insert the curtain rings into the rod one at a time. The user has to provide you with the ring number that needs to be inserted into the rod. When you get a number from the user, you need to insert the rings. The rings must be inserted from the left side of the rod and after inserting all the rings, display the ring numbers in the rod one by one.
